# :hamster: OVROverlayTest
A test of using OVROverlay with the Vive.

## :clipboard: Description
![screenshot](https://github.com/octopus8/OVROverlayTest/blob/master/%5BResources%5D/Example00.png)
Above is a screenshot of the app running on the GearVR. The quad on the left is drawn normally. The quad on the right is drawn using OVROverlay. The right quad is drawn significantly clearer than the quad on the left.

On the Vive, the OVROverlay quad is not drawn at all. The expected result is the OVROverlay quad is rendered when using the Vive.

## :loudspeaker: HELP!
Any help in obtaining the expected result is greatly appreciated!

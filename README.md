# :hamster: OVROverlayTest
A test of using OVROverlay with the Vive.

## :clipboard: Description
The OVROverlay quad is visible and is rendered at a higher quality than the normal quad on Android, but on the Vive the OVROverlay quad is not rendered.

The expected result is the OVROverlay quad is rendered when using the Vive.

## :loudspeaker: HELP!
Any help in obtaining the expected result is greatly appreciated!
